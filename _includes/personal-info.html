                <p class='text-justify'>Hi, This is Jingwei! I am a senior student from the <a href="http://en.sjtu.edu.cn/academics/schools/the-school-of-electronic-information-and-electrical-engineering/" class="text-white bg-dark">School of Electronic Information and Electrical Engineering (SEIEE)</a>, Shanghai Jiao Tong University (SJTU).

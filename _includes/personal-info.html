                <p class='text-justify'>I'm broadly interested in the computer music field, and my ultimate goal is to contribute to artificial music intelligence which renders better experience in creating, enjoying, and interacting with music. I've been engaged in several projects w.r.t. visiual and auditory perception, music interaction with robotics, deep music generation, etc. Currently, I'm focusing on arrangement generation via music representation learning. See my projects <a class="page-scroll" href="#Projects">here</a>.</p>
